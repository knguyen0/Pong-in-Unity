This is a recreation of the classic game Pong in the Unity engine. I wanted to practice C# which is native to Unity.

# Features

AI Controlled Paddle
* The second paddle is controlled using AI mimicking human behaviour. The AI follows the ball as it's travelling to the right. It will be able to intercept the ball until it reaches a certain velocity.

Matches Get Faster Over Time
* With every bounce, the ball increases in speed making the match harder as it progresses.


Scoring System
* Once the ball reaches a scoring zone, a point is given to the respective player.


Ball Reset
* After scoring, the ball is centred and starts in a random direction. 


Bounce Physics
* Unity's physics engine is utilised in order for the ball to bounce off of the borders and paddles correctly.

Changing Background
* The background smoothly transitions into another random colour.
